# IC-Stripline-Design

In the attached scanned document is some information about the specifications of designing an IC stripline

Additional Information:

This stripline is used to test the sensitivity of ICs to RF electromagnetic fields, evaluating their immunity in high frequency electromagnetic environments. The stripline provides a uniform electromagnetic field environment, allowing precise control of the field's intensity and frequency.
